## Course Assignment - WordPress as Headless CMS

For this project, I used WordPress as a Headless CMS to manage blog posts on a website deployed on Netlify. My goal was to create a list of blog posts, using WordPress only for its backend functionalities, and fetch the blog post data from the WordPress REST API using JavaScript.
